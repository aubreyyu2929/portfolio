                                <p> I think I was successful in this accessment although I didn't get a very high mark. I fully prepared the pitch and design the poster. Finally, I introduced my design concept for the audience clearly. I enjoy the whole process that I create and develop my concept design  </p>
                                <p>I get the feedback that "More research needed to outline the problem space and the key audience. This is generally a search engine and you need to be more innovative." In my opinions, I use treasure game of collecting mineral resource in QLD state to attract people discovery mineral history of Queensland. I think the idea is innovative. I start to rethink if I didn’t express my idea clearly or my poster not present my design concept directly. I think this is an important problem I should to fixed. Thus, I need improve my oral English and  communication skills. </p>

                            <p>I uploaded my poster and did pitch in the workshop. At the same time, I also watch my classmates' work and listen to their pitch, which inspires me. I saw a database I didn't notice before. It is a database record library and branch in QLD, and it also recorded the latitude, longitude, and open time and so on. I also saw many other topics such as fishing, travel, aboriginal language, game, map and so on.</p>
                            <p>For the serach engine page, we will provide a filter of distance and type for user to find reading spots in brisbane. And the user page includes, favorite page that user can star the reading spots they like, and footprints page that record where the user have been to, and the collections that record what the user posted articles in this Forum.</p>
                            <p>I did the pitch on Tuesday and my performance let me realize I am easy to be nervous when I make a speech to people. And I also compare my work to others, I think I still have a lot of things need to be improved.</p>

                            <p>On the contact, we decided an additional meeting time this week, and to make a schedule of the proposal. As a team leader, I have a little bit of pressure.

                            <p>I created a google drive and invited all team members in. Before the meeting, I will write an agenda which include meeting time/venue, meeting objectives, and who attend the meeting. In the meeting objectives, I will list all the contents we need to discuss and may face in the next couple of weeks</p>
                            <p>Follow the agenda, all team member can talk about their opinions and ideas, then we can edit the file together and put the conclusion of ideas in the file. After this step, we will also schedule what we need to finish this week in the Trello.</p>
                            <p>In this week, I did a online survey to research if our project can attract our target audience (<a href="https://forms.gle/PPQejNYLexTqxhGi7" target="_blank">Online survey</a>)</p>

                            <p>In this week, we've set up our prototype on uqclound, and I am responsible for the demo pitch, and wrote feedback questions and MVP (- filtering library which is nearest by you )of our project</p>
                            <p>Firstly, we discussed what is our business objective of the major project. We are doing the Brisbane Reading Spots which is a web-based application can help users find a suitable place for study and work. We also hope it can become a C2C platform finally, and it can related the merchants with customers. We are a platform produce searching service and a platform maintains and update merchants information.
        
                                    Then we start to think about what is our core functionality. After discussion, we all think our objectives are our core functionalities. 1. We need to filter a good study place for users according to their location and favorite. 2. We need to engage C2C interaction, for example, users can rank on each reading spots and they can also share it even if add a secret place in this website. 3. Using SLQ API to load library information on our website.</p>

                            <p>In this week, I am the speech of the demo pitch, and I feel I can't fully explain our demo and ideas because I did't control time well</p>
                            <p>After this week contact, we collected ours feedback and they recommend us, we should change the thme color of our navigation, because the color give people a sense of academic </p>
                            <p> Thus, I decide make the theme color more light after discussing with my team member</p>

                            <p>This week, I feel the time is limited, and we still have a lot of things didn't realzied on our website. For example, we want to do a recommendation options of libraries that is nearby the library was clicked by users in library information page</p>
                            <p>And after I saw our website on the zone, and test it by mobile phone, and I find it is not easy to use on mobile, then I decide to change it from mobile first to website, which is easy for our show this in the trade show</p>
                            <p>Also, I start help our coders type the css and html code with them, and I take charge of beautify website and I change the navigation bar layout in this week</p>

                            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                            <p><b>Primary Audience: </b>Our main target audience is white-collar workers and students who like to read. For workers, a library is a significant place. Based on the fierce competition in employment nowadays, workers also need to continue to learn in their free time in order to maintain their high employment value. Secondly, unlike students, students can enjoy the preferential treatment and quiet environments of the school library, such as free entry and free lending. It is difficult for workers to find a suitable reading place during work or free time. At this moment, the emergence of our website is meaningful. In addition, the website also provides event browsing. This means that users can not only read at the reading spot but also participate in some professional or non-professional activities to know more like-minded friends. For students, the meaning of the website is to facilitate the group of students who do not often go to school but enjoy the library atmosphere. As far as I am concerned, the location is closer to the State Library, and I prefer to go there instead of the uni library during the free time of the weekend. Then, off-campus reading spots can also make students contact with more friends besides students. Not only can they expand the scope of students' knowledge, but it can also bring them a happy experience.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Secondary Audience: </b> The definition of a website is for those people who are looking for a suitable reading spot, so anyone with this need can be our potential target audience. For example, parents can take their children to the reading point to accompany the learning process. Older people can go to the library to participate in some exciting social activities. Professionals can go to the library to access materials and participate in lectures. In short, as long as they are people who like to read, our website can provide them with different functions.

                            <p>
                                The purpose for us to design this website is to help the target audience quickly and accurately find the suitable place to learn or work. Traditionally, people may think that the library is the only place to study and read books. However, bookstores and some cafes are also good choices for quiet reading. On this website, we have integrated libraries, bookstores, and cafes as suitable choices for reading points, showing a list of results to choose from based on the user's search filter.

                                    In week 6, I generate my team in contact with the topic of Library. I suggested we should do a place recommendation site like Zomato, but it is focused on reading spots, after bringing my group members two basic ideas together.

But after I did the majoy reflection, I find fullpage only one screen size that can't contain the content I want to present. I have to think how to expend my each pages, and then I think I may use pop-up. In this process, I met a lot difficult such as I can pop-up a new html and colose it in my ideal position. Finally, I find fullpage pulgin have a option to expend one page by the class of "fp-scrollable, fp-scroller". </p>
                                <p>I also did a 360 degree reflection of the semester what I did in the course. I will keep develop it with more detial and more project I develop in the future.</p>

                                <p>Major Project is the most important part in this course, so I will discuss  the reflection of this part separately. It is a teamwork project and we need produce the project from initial idea to final prototype and trade show.  And the idea of our initial idea is based on our individual design exploration. In week 5 contact, I nailed down my initial idea of discovery the libraries in Brisbane with the SLQ dataset of QLD libraries and abandoned my initial design concept of Design exploration part as above. And we also named our project “Brisbane Reading Spots”. </p>

                                <h4>Initial Sketches</h4>
                                <p>This prototype is designed before we decided our minimum viable product. After we finished the proposal, we create these high fidelities prototype. According to my research that today people get used to using application find the place where to play, eat, and rest by someplace recommendation service, such as yelp, google map, Zomato, trip advisor and so on, we decided to design our website as mobile-first. Thus, you can find the prototype shown below is in mobile size. And as we design concept, we will separate our websites in three parts, recommendation part, search engine, and user part. The recommendation part will include the reading spots in Brisbane(for you page), event recommendation page, collection articles of Brisbane reading spots.</p>

                                <p>
                                    <li>Are you satisfied  with this search result by distance (MVP)?</li>
                                    <li>Which part is not to facilitate to you?
                                        </li>
                                    <li>Is it easy to use? Does it provide a good user experience for you?
                                        </li>
                                    <li>Which functionalities you like the best?</li>
                            
                                </p>
                                <h6>Feedbacks from users</h6>
                                <p>1.	After we present the demo to user, some users express they feel the home (for you) page have the same function as the search page and tell us to make the two pages become distinguished. Therefore, we change the grid layout of libraries in the for you page to map displaying their location. When user click the book icon on the map, they can see the name and address of libraries.</p>
                                <p>2.	In initial idea we intend to design the website as mobile first, but in the test progress, we find when we display the information by sql api, it is slow to open by touch screen. Users always need to click multiple times and then get a slow response. Thus, we decided to present our website by PC. And we hope it can help us easy to present our website. </p>
                                <p>3.	Most users are satisfied with the search results and it is easy to understand our purpose of the website, although it doesn’t display the library in Queensland university because of the limitation of data. </p>
                                <p>4.	Someone like the forum ideas, and he advised us can add a study buddy part for users to find people to study with. We love this idea, but we didn’t put it in the plan because of time bound and technical limitation. It is an improvement we can add it to our website in the future. </p>
                                <p>In this period from part B to part C, We also met techinical problems and time limitaiton. Thus, we use some simulation page to instand of our initial idea, such as collection page, and event page. We add all information in these two page manually. Below I shown is our final product, you can compare the diffrence with initial prototype.</p>

                                <p>I am super excited with the trade show because the atmosphere is amzing and other groups' works are also inspire me. Overall, the results of the tradeshow is positive. I am one of presenter in our group becuase the intial design concept is come out of me and I also be in charge of research, challenges,reflection part. Audiences ask two question frequently - "what API you used?", "How you attract people use your product and why they use it?“. I remember I reply them there are lots of diffrence place reccomendation service application but none of them recoomend reading spots. The advantage of us is that our website purely provide reccomendation about reading, such as some good events in library or good reading spots. In the future, we can develp our website as a communication center of reading. </p>
                                <p>This is a good opportunity to take exercise on my communication abilities and a chance to present our product. I think the core of trade show is selling yourself, so how make you become attractive is important. I saw other group have some interesting game and competition, which inspired me and left a deep impression. In the future, I can do better. </p>                                
                                <p>In general, I am satisfied with the outcome of the website, such as purpose, layout, and MVP. Our purpose of a website can help our target audience find their own reading spots efficiently, although the functionality is not completed as the initial plan. Especially, I like our website theme color, logo, and slogan. Our logo is a duckbill with a pair of glass is, which corresponds to our purpose. And the theme color is blue, which gives the audience a feeling of academic. </p>               
                                <p>Where we lack may in the part of images and relevant contents of events, bookstores, and cafes. As our initial idea, the reading spots can be found on our website is not limited to libraries. We also will recommend all possible places for the user to study. For example, if the user is a white-collar worker, she may prefer to read and work in a relaxing place, then we will provide the choice of the cafe and some fancy bookstores in Brisbane. But now, we can’t produce enough reading spots for the user to pick the most suitable one to read. </p>
                                <h4>Group Work Reflection</h4>
                                <p>I think teamwork has two side. One side is its benefit, and the other one is its challenge. In a team, I can share my workload for the entire team, which can increase work productivity and the quality if the team members work well together. The challenge of teamwork includes conflicts and balance of workload. If the leader didn’t keep the balance of workload between team  members, the people who did little would feel left out sometime, and people who did a lot would feel unbalanced. Besides, trust together, design roles clearly and esteem are also important factor. </p>
                                <p>I feel honoured that I can be the leader in our team, which give me a chance to anneal my organization and management skill  Then I will discuss my feeling of this group work in communication, work management, meeting, conflict, and misconduct below.</p>
                                <p><b>Communication: </b>In the process I communicate with my team members by WeChat and face-to-face talk. I think face-to-face talk is more efficiently than send massage online. Thus, sometimes I will arrange two meeting in one week. One meeting is for work allocation, and the other one is for us to work together can talk about the difficulties we face individually. I feel as a team leader I should listen my team members advices in the project, which I did well. But I didn’t push my team members to finish one goal sometimes, because I am not this kind of guy. I afraid that I over push my team members to work on something and cause dissatisfaction.</p>
                                <p><b>Work Management: </b>In most cases, I will list all the thing we should finish this week and let team member choose which one they want to do.In this process, I found a problem that a team member Runan CHEN is busy with her study, and she always has excuse such as she can’t do this because she busy with other team work. And my other team member and I will express understanding and then we will do the workload she should take. I think I am failed to allocate work in balance. I should push her to do something. </p>
                                <p><b>Meeting: </b>At weekly meeting, I delegate task and tell them where we are meeting before one, they, and list what we should discuss in agenda in advance. I also estimate time we need cost on the meeting well. I am stratified with this part. </p>
                                <p><b>Conflict: </b>We are  a harmony team, although we all have a lot of ideas, but we will bring them together well.  We never have conflict in this project. Thus, I think I am successful in this aspect.</p>
                                <p><b>Misconduct: </b>I will give my team member 12 hours extension if they didn’t finish the work I delegated. But sometimes I am too busy to check what they have done, or I will check if they finished but not check the quality of the work, which lead in part C, we find our website exists a lot of bug. I think I still need improve this aspect.</p>
                                <p><b></b></p>
                                <h4>Improvement</h4>

                                    <li>Use more existing plugin to design our website and realize the functionalities we expect, which can help us save time.</li>
                                    <li>Design the construction of website first then realize the functionality.</li>

                                    <li>I will help my coders to do the html and css first, but in this project, I did it at second half. Thus, I changed a lot of work they did before because they aim to realize the functionality first. </li>
                                    <li>As a team leader, I should not only focus on if they finished the work on time, I should also care about the quality of the work they done. </li>
                                    <li> In the trade show, the judge ask me "Why people use your website to serach reading spots?" let me realize our product is not attractive enough. I should consider more interacitities and user experience when we design the prototype.</li>

                                <p><b>Look back to my first journal post:</b></p>
                                <p class="quote">"Based on what I know of this course, I expect to be doing a good project with my group member and improve my coding and design ability in 365 degrees this semester.
                                        <li>
                                             I want to learn PHP as I never learnt it before and to improve my JavaScript.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            I’m worried about if my technology can complete the idea I imaged, and I also worried about if I can have good teamwork with team members.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            I hope that I can improve my communication ability. Plus, I also hope I can have a big improvement in my design and coding ability.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            In the end, I expect I can know new guys and learn from them in this course and create an excellent project with my team members in the trade show.  " 
                                        </li>
                                </p>
                                <p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have much time to develop my PHP skills and JavaScript skills, because we have two main developers who are in charge of these two languages and I am in charge of CSS and part of web design. </p>
                                <p>For the project expectation, I am happy with our final product, although it is not perfect. During the project, I mainly take responsibility for doing pitch and prepare documents of the proposal, report, pitch and poster, which help me improve my communication ability and let me know I need improve more in the future. </p>
                                <p>In the process of a major project, I also know new friends and learnt their advantages in this process. For example, my two developers work serious and they never gave up developing some hard functionality, such as filter library by distance or login system, though they haven’t experience develop it. They are my friends, my team buddies, and my teachers</p>

                                <p>                               
                                    <li>I learnt how to work as a team and how to be a team leader</li>
                                    <li>I learnt how to use API and how PHP works in praticals</li>
                                    <li>I learnt design thinking in contacts and lectures</li>
                                    <li>I also learnt diffrent people have differnet expectation in the quality of work, I should respect them and tell them what I want.</li>
                                    Thank you everyone in this course and I enjoy the time I participate in this course.

                                    <li>I think we may need have more weeks arrangement on group works. </li>
                                    <li>For the pratical, I think it should focus on techincal skills not design because we already learnt it in contact and lecture.</li>
