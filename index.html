                        <p>My name is Aubrey Yu and I am an international student majoring in Master of Information Technology. My undergraduate degree is in Public Relations. I enjoy studying tech-related knowledge and big data, such as web developed, data mining, and machine learning. I hope I can bring these two majors together and develop a social media analysis system.  </p>
                        <p>I was born in Shanghai, China, but now I live in Brisbane where I study in my master’s degree at University of Queensland. </p>
                        <P>My bio is <q>“what I cannot create, I do not understand.”</q> Keep improving on everything! </P>

                                    <li>Otherwise, they can also post a question on the Forum, and students or others can reply to the question.</li>
                                    <li>The dataset can also be improved by others who can add the information which is not complete.</li>

                                <p> I think I was successful in this accessment although I didn't get a very high mark. I fully prepared the pitch and design the poster. Finally, I introduced my design concept for the audience clearly. I enjoy the whole process that I create and develop my concept design  </p>
                                <p>I get the feedback that "More research needed to outline the problem space and the key audience.  This is generally a search engine and you need to be more innovative." In my opinions, I use treasure game of collecting mineral resource in QLD state to attract people discovery mineral history of queensland. I think the idea is innovative and I deserve a higher grade actually. And I also did interviews with target users to ask if they like this idea, which received a lot postive feedbacks </p>

                            <p>I uploaded my poster and did pitch in the workshop. At the same time, I also watch my classmates' work and listen to their pitch, which inspires me. I saw a database I didn't notice before. It is a database record library and branch in QLD, and it also recorded the latitude, longitude, and open time and so on. I also saw many other topics such as fishing, travel, aboriginal language, game, map and so on.</p>
                            <p>I did the pitch on Tuesday and my performance let me realize I am easy to be nervous when I make a speech to people. And I also compare my work to others, I think I still have a lot of things need to be improved.</p>

I created a group folder on google drive and shared link before the meeting. I also decided to use Trello as a tool to organize our project and allocate tasks.</p>

                            <h2>Week 7</h2>
                            <p>I created a google drive and invited all team members in. Before the meeting, I will write an agenda which include meeting time/venue, meeting objectives, and who attend the meeting. In the meeting objectives, I will list all the contents we need to discuss and may face in the next couple of weeks</p>
                            <p>Follow the agenda, all team member can talk about their opinions and ideas, then we can edit the file together and put the conclusion of ideas in the file. After this step, we will also schedule what we need to finish this week in the Trello.</p>
                            <p>In this week, I did a online survey to research if our project can attract our target audience (<a href="https://forms.gle/PPQejNYLexTqxhGi7" target="_blank">Online survey</a>)</p>

                            <p>In this week, we've set up our prototype on uqclound, and I am responsible for the demo pitch, and wrote feedback questions and MVP (- filtering library which is nearest by you )of our project</p>
                            <p>Firstly, we discussed what is our business objective of the major project. We are doing the Brisbane Reading Spots which is a web-based application can help users find a suitable place for study and work. We also hope it can become a C2C platform finally, and it can related the merchants with customers. We are a platform produce searching service and a platform maintains and update merchants information.
        
                                    Then we start to think about what is our core functionality. After discussion, we all think our objectives are our core functionalities. 1. We need to filter a good study place for users according to their location and favorite. 2. We need to engage C2C interaction, for example, users can rank on each reading spots and they can also share it even if add a secret place in this website. 3. Using SLQ API to load library information on our website.</p>

                            <p>In this week, I am the speech of the demo pitch, and I feel I can't fully explain our demo and ideas because I did't control time well</p>
                            <p>After this week contact, we collected ours feedback and they recommend us, we should change the thme color of our navigation, because the color give people a sense of academic </p>
                            <p> Thus, I decide make the theme color more light after discussing with my team member</p>
                            <p>Theme color: #59AEA9, #BECCD5, #3d9cc</p>

                            <p>This week, I feel the time is limited, and we still have a lot of things didn't realzied on our website. For example, we want to do a recommendation options of libraries that is nearby the library was clicked by users in library information page</p>
                            <p>And after I saw our website on the zone, and test it by mobile phone, and I find it is not easy to use on mobile, then I decide to change it from mobile first to website, which is easy for our show this in the trade show</p>
                            <p>Also, I start help our coders type the css and html code with them, and I take charge of beautify website and I change the navigation bar layout in this week</p>

                            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                            <p><b>Primary Audience: </b>Our main target audience is white-collar workers and students who like to read. For workers, a library is a significant place. Based on the fierce competition in employment nowadays, workers also need to continue to learn in their free time in order to maintain their high employment value. Secondly, unlike students, students can enjoy the preferential treatment and quiet environments of the school library, such as free entry and free lending. It is difficult for workers to find a suitable reading place during work or free time. At this moment, the emergence of our website is meaningful. In addition, the website also provides event browsing. This means that users can not only read at the reading spot but also participate in some professional or non-professional activities to know more like-minded friends. For students, the meaning of the website is to facilitate the group of students who do not often go to school but enjoy the library atmosphere. As far as I am concerned, the location is closer to the State Library, and I prefer to go there instead of the uni library during the free time of the weekend. Then, off-campus reading spots can also make students contact with more friends besides students. Not only can they expand the scope of students' knowledge, but it can also bring them a happy experience.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Secondary Audience: </b> The definition of a website is for those people who are looking for a suitable reading spot, so anyone with this need can be our potential target audience. For example, parents can take their children to the reading point to accompany the learning process. Older people can go to the library to participate in some exciting social activities. Professionals can go to the library to access materials and participate in lectures. In short, as long as they are people who like to read, our website can provide them with different functions.

                            <p>
                                The purpose for us to design this website is to help the target audience quickly and accurately find the suitable place to learn or work. Traditionally, people may think that the library is the only place to study and read books. However, bookstores and some cafes are also good choices for quiet reading. On this website, we have integrated libraries, bookstores, and cafes as suitable choices for reading points, showing a list of results to choose from based on the user's search filter.

                                    In week 6, I generate my team in contact with the topic of Library. I suggested we should do a place recommendation site like Zomato, but it is focused on reading spots, after bringing my group members two basic ideas together.
